# Laravel Actions IDE Helper

This packages generates IDE helpers for [Laravel Actions v2](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions). Feedback appreciated. Discussion at https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions/issues/117.

## YOLO-ware

As I don't use Laravel Actions anymore I decided to go into `YOLO-mode` with this project. That means:

1. **No guarantees** 
2. **Community-powered fixes**: Something doesn't work, you notice it you fix it.
3. **Trust in the community:** I won't test your changes, either they do work or they don't. I just merge them.
4. **Looking for a maintainer:** This situation is less than ideal. Therefore, I am looking for a new maintainer to take over this project. 

## Installation

```
composer require --dev wulfheart/laravel-actions-ide-helper
```

## Usage
```
php artisan ide-helper:actions
